# Rudimentary-Pincode-Reading-System-BinInvContourDetection-LeNet-5
This project is an attempt to replicate the world's first computer vision system. In the 80s the US Postal Service required a system to automatically recognize handwritten Zip Codes to sort mail more efficiently. Yann LeCun et. al. took on this challenge &amp; eventually ended up proposing LeNet-5. I have replicated the legacy system from the 80s.
